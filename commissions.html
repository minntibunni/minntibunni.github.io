                        <br />
                        <br />
                        i will not start the commission unless i have been paid

                        me sending the invoice and accepting the commission then
                        i will assume that you no longer want the commission and
                        will cancel it.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        i will only accept up to 3 revisions in the sketch
                        stage, once the final payment has been made i will not
                        be able to change anything in the art.

                        blacklisted.

                        you are allowed to post the finished commission on

                        by commissioning me, you have automatically accepted my

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        i will not start the commission unless i have been paid
                        the money upfront.

                        me sending the invoice and accepting the commission then
                        i will assume that you no longer want the commission and
                        will cancel it.

                    <p>
                      when ordering a commission i have to collect these data
                      from you: your contact information, name/username and
                      information about the commission that you are ordering.
                      this is to ensure that i will be able to collect payment
                      and complete and send you the finished commission. other
                      information that i will be able to see are payment details
                      through stripe if you use a credit/debit card such as the
                      last 4 digits of the card number (not the full number as
                      that is hidden from me), expiry date and your post code
                      (not the full address as only the post code can be entered
                      in the payment form). this is so that i get paid for the
                      commission. data about the commission is stored on a
                      google sheet and payment details are stored in my stripe
                      account which are both protected through two factor
                      authentication. the only information that may be shared to
                      the public is your name/username if i share the commission
                      on social media. the rest of the information won't be
                      shared with anyone else.
