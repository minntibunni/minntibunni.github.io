            <h1>you've met minty milk!</h1>
            <p>minty milk is a mintbunny who lives in a large home near the centre of the neighbourhood. she's very full of herself and boasts about all the amazing things that she has done, though she makes up most of her "incredible feats"!</p>
            <br>
            <p>minty milk owns a dairy shop and uses a "secret" recipe to produce special milk to use in her dairy products. except everyone knows her recipe is just almond milk with mint leaves infused inside as she keeps boasting about it! either way, the mintbunnies love her dairy products and many of them use them for their own businesses making her shop very successful much to the annoyance of chocola chip.
