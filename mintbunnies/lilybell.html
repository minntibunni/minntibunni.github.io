            <h1>you've met lilybell!</h1>
            <p>lilybell is a mintbunny who lives in a large home near the centre of the neighbourhood. she's talkative and friendly and loves to help the other mintbunnies find ways to decorate their homes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>lilybell owns the flower shop and creates bouquets and flower arrangements that the other mintbunnies use to decorate their homes and gift to others. she loves her job and can be seen there so often that the other mintbunnies are convinced that she lives there! she employed cherry blossom thinking that the extra help would be nice but instead she ended up being a pain to work with. she still allows her to work at her shop though because sometimes cherry blossom can actually be helpful when she's focussing!
