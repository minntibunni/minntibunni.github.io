                      <p>
                        yesterday i successfully finished my (almost) year long hunt for a shiny girafarig!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="https://file.garden/aH6gV0OEQybcML-a/blog/shiny-girafarig.jpg" alt="An image showing the shiny Girafarig Pokémon I caught and the shiny Ferret I have named Strawberry." style="max-width: 300px;"/>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        it took me <span style="font-weight: bold;">31748</span> encounters doing around 100 random encounters everyday. a lot of the time i really just wanted to continue playing the game (at this point i forgot what i was doing before i started hunting for the giraffe) but i decided to keep on going! i got three phases, a shiny venonat (that i forgot to take a picture of, forgot the number of encounters it took and killed by accident 〒﹏〒 ), my first shiny flaafy at 20489 re's - raspberry and a second shiny flaafy at 25541 re's that i decided to let go!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        i watched a bunch of different series and movies while hunting like past life, kpop demon hunters and toilet bound hanako kun - they were all super fun and i'm kinda going to miss watching things while shiny hunting! it also feels so weird not dedicating like an hour or two just pressing the dpad (￣▽￣*)ゞ but now i have more time for other things like actually playing the game!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        in my pokemon saves i try to plan a team of cute pokemon i like and hunt them all down even if it takes a super long time, it's really rewarding when you finally are able to complete the team! for this save i wanted a shiny chikorita, a marill, a shiny togepi (okay i kind of cheated and decided to masuda hunt it in ultra sun then hack it into the game hehe), a mareep (i wanted and caught a normal one but since i got a shiny flaafy i sadly replaced the original one! he had a green tail so that makes him slightly better), a shiny sentret and a shiny girafarig! the chikorita hunt took so long, i think it was a two year long on and off hunt and i got a shiny totodile as a phase on my birthday! i ended up getting a female shiny in the end which made me super happy so i guess it was kind of worth the long wait! i was going to name her autumn but i decided to name her maple instead and went for a food theme with the rest of the team! the sentret took a few months and now i have a cute pink ferret i named strawberry! i named the togepi cream, the marill milk and named my original mareep banana but my new flaafy is named raspberry. my shiny girafarig is called tiramisu! (i was having trouble thinking of a blue food that wasn't blueberry - i really didn't want to name her that haha)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        that was a lot of yapping that i didn't realise i did while typing it out oops, super excited to finish this save though and move on to the next games! i'm going in order of release date and i'm super excited to play the gen 5 games (i've heard too much praise for it), for now i might also shiny hunt my next starter in platinum - the tortoise which i forgot its name (x﹏x)

                        <p> i just randomly had an idea on how this blog should look like and i'm super happy with how it turned out :3
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            i've always wanted a space to randomly talk about things but i didn't want to ramble on my art accounts cus i thought it would clutter it since they're unrelated but thanks to this site now i have a space to talk!
