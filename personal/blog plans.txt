nat's home:

little status updates using the chibi i made so like the chibi has a chat bubble saying short status on how i feel can merge with -> maybe a current status thingy like what arunyi has with the currently feeling, currently watching, currently playing stuff like that

a proper blog where i can put longer messages and stuff

change music in juke box chukichukipokopon to momofanmoran and furo hairu profile to take medicine and go to sleep

my outfits? (irl and the ones i make for the persona)

digital pets i own on the net? ig rn that would just be the tomonotchi but i can add to it whenever i want!!

shrines (unrelated af):

kasumin shrine needs to have info about her but ALSO a collection of all the beautiful things that have her super kawaii little face on there that i own :33333
